### End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline using Databricks & Delta Live Tables

This repository presents a **production-style data engineering pipeline** built on **Databricks** to ingest, process, and serve transportation trip data using a **Bronze–Silver–Gold architecture**.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

![System Architecture](3.%20other_files/architecture.png)

The system simulates a real-world transportation platform where trip events are generated by an application and stored in a relational database.  
Data is extracted via a data fetch service, landed into object storage, and processed in Databricks for analytics and reporting.

## 🔄 Databricks Delta Live Tables Pipeline

![DLT Pipeline Graph](3.%20other_files/Screenshot%202026-02-01%20at%2016.45.43.png)

The pipeline is implemented using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)**, providing automated dependency management, data quality enforcement, and clear lineage across processing stages.

---

## 🧠 Solution Overview

The pipeline addresses common data engineering challenges:
- Scalable ingestion of transportation trip data  
- Incremental and streaming data processing  
- Data quality validation and business rule enforcement  
- Separation of raw, cleaned, and analytics-ready datasets  
- Observability and lineage through Databricks DLT  

---

## 🧱 Data Architecture

### 🥉 Bronze Layer
- Raw ingestion of trip data from object storage (S3)
- Streaming tables for incremental data arrival
- Minimal transformations to preserve source data

### 🥈 Silver Layer
- Data cleansing and standardization
- Business validations (dates, ratings, categories)
- CDC-style upserts using Delta Live Tables
- Enriched dimensions such as city and calendar

### 🥇 Gold Layer
- Analytics-ready fact tables
- City-level aggregations
- Optimized views for BI dashboards and reporting

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Databricks  
- Apache Spark (PySpark)  
- Delta Live Tables (DLT)  
- Delta Lake  
- AWS S3  
- SQL  
- Unity Catalog
